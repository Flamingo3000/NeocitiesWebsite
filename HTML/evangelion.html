                    evangelion is an anime series directed by Hideaki Anno first
                    aired in the 4th of october 1995
                    <br />
                    The series explores the experiences and emotions of
                    Evangelion pilots and members of Nerv as they try to prevent
                    Angels from causing more cataclysms. <br />
                    In the process, they are called upon to understand the
                    ultimate causes of events and the motives for human action.
                    <br />
                    The series has been described as a deconstruction of the
                    mecha genre and it features archetypal imagery derived from
                    Shinto cosmology as well as Jewish and Christian mystical
                    traditions. <br />
                    <br />
                    Ultimatly, Evangelion is a show about depression, loss, and
                    its depths. <br />
                    It treats its main topics with maturity and seriousness.
                    <br />
                    Its constrasting and contradictory depictions of ones
                    feelings are a masterclass is writing; while not taking the
                    spotlight from its direction, editing and its experimental
                    finale, it is defnetly the part of evangelion that interests
                    me the most. <br />
                    Apart from the giant robots ofc
